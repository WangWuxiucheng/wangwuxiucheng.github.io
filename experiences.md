## Undergraduate Senior Design Project
`Spring 2017` *Digital System/Microcontroller-based Senior Design*

**[GUITAMATIC- A automatic guitar player machine project page](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece477/Archive/2017/Spring/477grp15/)**

The project is an automatic guitar playing machine. It reads a MIDI file and translates that to mechanical movement, which plucks the guitar strings and presses on the notes accordingly. It is able to mimic a guitarist. 

- Won the <u>First place</u> in Purdue Spark Challenge Competition, out of about 50 teams.
- Hardware & Mechanical Designer
	- Designed, implemented and tested STM32 based microcontroller and 24V solenoid driver circuit. 
	- Integration of the software and hardware.
	- Designed, processed and assembled the mechanical support structure using a milling machine, bandsaw, and belt sander.
- Project documentation and team webpage maintenance.
