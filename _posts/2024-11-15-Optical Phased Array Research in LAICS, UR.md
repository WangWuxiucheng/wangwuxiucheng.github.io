#### Research Objective {#obj}
The objective of my research is to design optical phased array (OPA) circuits and systems capable of rapid beamsteering and efficient information transmission. While the wave diffraction and interference nature of phased arrays enable light-speed beamsteering, the design, implementation, control, and analysis of OPAs remain significant engineering challenges. Once it succeeds, it will represents a fundamental advance in **LiDAR** and **free-space optical communication**. It would also improve our abillity to precisely manipulate light beams in a finer scale, enabling new applications for sensing, 3D-printing and light-matter interactions.

#### Challenges {#hard}
OPA beamsteering requires active control and is challenging to accomplish because it demands seamless coordination between the photonic chip (PIC) and its peripherial electronics, akin to a harmonic symphony. A control program acts as a symphony conductor, guiding the system to adhere to its calibration data and steering coefficients while minimizing crosstalk within the photonic chip. Calibrations serves as the symphony's rehearsal, ensuring optimal performance, and only through the analysis program can the best  calibration data be identified during these rehearsals.

#### Project Timeline {#hist}
`2016-2019` The OPA project was first initiated and executed by Dr.Francis Smith in 2016 for OPA concept verification. I joined the group in Fall 2017 as a M.S student, worked with Dr. Smith on OPA device, circuit level simulations, electronics, test setup construction and automation. By the end of 2018, we successfully achieved OPA beamsteering and attracted funding to continue the project.

`2019-2024` Dr.Smith graduated in 2019. In January 2019, I became a Ph.D student and continued the project. I came up new ideas and tapeouted new photonic chips through various foundries(IMEC, AMF and AIM). My research focused on improving OPA system performance, such as beamsteering speed, range, accuracy, and power efficiency. Meanwhile, I developed customized electronics to scale down the whole system size from bench-top to a more portable version as well as explored OPA-based free-space optical communication.

#### Project Demo {#demo}

An OPA system and its beamsteering and spatical multiplexing are demonstrated in the following sections.

##### Photonics {#SiPh}
We develop our integrated OPA circuits on silicon photonics platform. Below is a 4x4 OPA that implemented subarray configuration.

##### Testsetup Evolution {#setupEvo}
The PIC needs active controls for beamsteering. Two generations of benchtop test setups and two generations of OPA driver/packages were developed to integrate and control OPA PICs. The following images show the evolution of our test setups.

`2018` 32-channel analog outputs and automation to control OPA chip.

`2020` 64-channel analog input, outputs to control OPA chip. The analog inputs serve as electrical feedbacks to enable more precise control. The system update rate is 2ms per steering.

`2021-2022` Customized hardware (driver board, MCU board) and package with 64-channel analog inputs, outputs to control OPA chip. The package is temperature controlled by a TEC unit. The MCU board allows standalone contorl or PC-control. The system update rate is 350 microseconds per steering, which is 5X+ faster than the previous system.

##### Electronics {#elec}

We developed our customized hardware as shown in the following:

The driver board provides all the analog inputs and outputs. Digital controls and power supplies are connected through a flex-cable to the MCU board.

##### Beamsteering {#steer}

With both the photonics and electronics, we finally can perform beamforming and beamsteering.
