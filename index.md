[//]: # (This project is a slight customization based off of some great work by NC State University Libraries

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Laboratory for Advanced Integrated Circuits and Systems (LAICS)](https://www.hajim.rochester.edu/ece/sites/laics/research-projects/) at the University of Rochester, NY, USA. Supervisor: [Prof. Hui Wu](https://www.hajim.rochester.edu/ece/people/faculty/wu_hui/index.html).

My research focuses on optoelectronics and silicon photonics, particularly in Optical Phased Array (OPA). My studies span a broad spectrum including **silicon photonic integrated optical phased array and its peripheral electronics**, **circuit & system level control, automation and optimization for OPA**, and **OPA free-space optical communication**. My research contributions have been recognized and presented at world-renowned, peer-reviewed conferences and journals such as CLEO, IPC, GFP, and OE.
