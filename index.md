[//]: # (This project is a slight customization based off of some great work by NC State University Libraries

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Laboratory for Advanced Integrated Circuits and Systems](https://www.hajim.rochester.edu/ece/sites/laics/research-projects/), University of Rochester, NY, USA.

My research focuses on optoelectronics and silicon photonics, particularly in optical phased array (OPA). My work include a broad spectrum of studies, such as **photonic integrated device/circuit design**, **electronic peripheral design**, **circuit and system level control, automation and optimization**, and **free-space optical communication**.
My research contributions have been recognized and presented at world-renowned, peer-reviewed conferences and journals such as CLEO, IPC, GFP, and OE.
